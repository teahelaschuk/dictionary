# dictionary

An English dictionary, broken down into syllables separated by an '=' character
This dictionary and formatted for my haiku generator site. 

Words that can be edited/deleted:
+ any abbrevaitions (ex. MPH, AVG...)
+ unnecessary places and names (ex. Max Mler, Da Gama)
+ any broken words, words with missing or special characters
+ archaic, non-obvious non-english words, medical/scientific words, or other words that may be ridiculous in the context of a haiku


This dictionary is based on pre-syllablized dictionary from an open-source project. They request that all references to the original project be removed if the text is altered.
